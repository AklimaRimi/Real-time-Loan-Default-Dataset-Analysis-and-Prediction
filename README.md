## Overview
This project helps banks and financial institutions predict whether a loan will default. By using machine learning and big data tools, we make the process faster, smarter, and data-driven. We use Databricks, Kafka, and Power BI to handle large datasets in real time and present clear insights.

## Introduction

### Why This Matters
Traditional loan risk assessment methods can be slow and inaccurate, leading to financial losses. This project introduces a smarter way to analyze loan default risks using data and machine learning to improve decision-making.

### Goals
- Build an efficient system to analyze loan default risks.
- Process and clean data for better insights.
- Test and compare machine learning models for predicting loan defaults.
- Visualize key trends using Power BI.

## How It Works

1. **Collect Data**: Loan-related details (income, credit score, loan amount, etc.) [Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/loan-default-dataset).
2. **Process Data**: Handle missing values and refine key features.
3. **Select ML Models**: Compare Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting to find the best.
4. **Real-Time Prediction**: Use Kafka to process loan default risks instantly.
5. **Visualize Data**: Create easy-to-understand reports in Power BI.
6. **Integrate Everything**: Use Databricks for smooth workflow and scalability.
7. **Code Implementation:** [Code](https://github.com/AklimaRimi/Real-time-Loan-Default-Dataset-Analysis-and-Prediction/tree/main/Scripts)

## Key Insights

- **Loan Defaults**: 36.64K loans defaulted.
- **Property & Occupancy**: 93% of loan-backed properties belong to a single occupancy type.
- **Loan Type Trends**: Type 1 and 3 have higher default amounts; Type 2 defaults less.
- **Security Preference**: Direct security-backed loans have lower default rates.
- **Loan Purpose**: p1 and p3 have the most defaults.
- **Income & Gender**: Joint applicants have the highest income; males and females show balanced default rates.
- **Credit Score & Age**: Older applicants have higher credit scores; younger ones are more prone to defaults.
