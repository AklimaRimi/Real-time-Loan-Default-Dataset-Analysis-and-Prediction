# Real-time-Loan-Default-Dataset-Analysis-and-Prediction

# Loan Analysis & Prediction Project

## Overview
This project helps banks and financial institutions decide whether to approve or reject loan applications. By using machine learning and big data tools, we make the process faster, more accurate, and data-driven. We leverage Databricks, Kafka, and Power BI to handle large amounts of loan data in real time and present useful insights visually.

## Introduction

### Background
Traditional loan approval methods can be slow and inaccurate, leading to financial risks. This project introduces a smarter way to analyze loan applications using data and machine learning to improve decision-making.

### Objectives
- Develop a system that efficiently analyzes loan data.
- Clean and process loan data for better insights.
- Test different machine learning models to predict loan approvals.
- Present key findings using interactive dashboards in Power BI.

## Literature Review
We reviewed studies on loan risk analysis, the role of machine learning in finance, and the impact of real-time data processing to establish a solid foundation for our project.

## Methodology

### How It Works
1. **Data Collection**: Gather loan-related data, including income, credit score, and loan amount [Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/loan-default-dataset).
2. **Data Processing**: Clean the data by handling missing values and selecting relevant features.
3. **Model Selection**: Evaluate different machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting) to determine the best performer.
4. **Real-Time Predictions**: Utilize Kafka to process loan applications instantly.
5. **Data Visualization**: Use Power BI to create interactive charts and dashboards.
6. **Integration**: Connect all tools using Databricks for smooth workflow and scalability.

## Data Insights & Visualizations
We analyze the loan dataset and create visual reports, including:
- **Loan Approval Statistics** (Scoreboard analysis)
- **Property Value vs. Occupation Type** (Pie chart)
- **Loan Amount vs. Loan Type** (Horizontal bar chart)
- **Total Units vs. Security Type** (Bar chart)
- **Interest Rate vs. Loan Purpose** (Gantt chart)
- **Income vs. Gender** (Donut chart)
- **Credit Score vs. Age & Status** (Line plot)

Power BI helps turn complex data into simple, easy-to-understand visual insights.

## Conclusion

### Summary
This project successfully integrates big data, machine learning, and visualization to enhance loan approval processes. By using Databricks, Kafka, and Power BI, we ensure real-time predictions and efficient data processing. Future improvements will focus on increasing model accuracy and incorporating additional data sources for better decision-making.
